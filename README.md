2018 AQA Computer Science A-Level Project

This project was written in 2018 so some of the libraries used are difficult to install now.<br />
The required libraries are pymouse and tkinter. PyMouse was abandoned years ago so may not be functional anymore.<br />
A version using new, working libraries is in the works.
